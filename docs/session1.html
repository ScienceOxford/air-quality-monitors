    <h1>Session 1: programming the sensors and LCD screen</h1>
    <br>
  </header>

  <div id="introduction" class="left">
    <h3>Getting started with your ESP32 and MicroPython</h3>
    <p>An <strong>ESP32</strong> will be the brains of your device, and you will attach various inputs and outputs to it.</p>
    <p>We will be programming it in Python during this club; the version of Python used is <strong>MicroPython</strong>, which means that it's a smaller version of the full Python programming language designed to run on <strong>microcontrollers</strong> such as the ESP32 and micro:bit.</p>
    <p>A lot of background set-up code has been prepared in advance, and so you will use lots of <strong>libraries</strong> in your program. This is how professional programmers work - it is unusual to start everything from scratch yourself!</p>
    <br>
    <p>We will be using <a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</a> as the editor during these workshops.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Running code</h5>
    <p>Code is saved in two places - on your computer, and on the ESP32.</p>
    <p>While you are working on the code, run it from your computer (it will still interact with the ESP32) - only when you are happy with it should you upload it to the device.</p>
    <img src=".\images\..." alt="screenshot of the Thonny editor, with the file system open, showing files on the computer and files on the device. A file on the computer named first-test.py is highlighted" width="400" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Double-click on the file named <strong>first-test.py</strong> to open it.</p>
    <p><strong>Without changing anything</strong>, click the Run button on Thonny's menu.</p>
    <img src=".\images\..." alt="screenshot of the Thonny editor's menu, with the Run button highlighted" width="400" height="auto">
    <br>
    <br>
    <h5>What does the code do?</h5>
    <p><strong>Look at Thonny's terminal</strong> - what information are you being given?</p>
    <p><strong>Look at your ESP32</strong> - what is it doing?</p>
    <p><strong>Look at your LCD screen</strong> - what is it showing?</p>
    <br>
    <p>The terminal is very useful for <strong>debugging</strong>. We use this syntax to send messages to it:</p>
    <pre>print("this message will show on the terminal!")</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>In this code, to pause between commands, we are not using standard <code>sleep()</code> functions - this is because of all the background code that needs to keep <strong>in sync</strong> with everything else.</p>
    <p>To pause, we use this syntax:</p>
    <pre>await asyncio.sleep(1)</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The ESP32's <strong>built-in LED is flashing</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you find the line of code that controls this?</li>
      <li>How do you think you would change the speed?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="lcd" class="left">
    <h3>Using the LCD screen</h3>
    <p>The screen has two lines which you can put information on in the form of strings.</p>
    <p>Because Python usually starts counting from zero,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The top line is <code>lcd[0]</code></li>
      <li>The bottom line is <code>lcd[1]</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the screen has been set up, you set the string that you want each line to show.</p>
    <pre>    lcd = LCD()
    lcd[0] = "Welcome to"
    lcd[1] = "Science Oxford"</pre>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Try changing the strings, to change what is displayed on the screen.</li>
      <li>What happens if you give it information that is longer than the screen?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Extra challenge:</h5>
    <p>Test out this code:</p>
    <pre>lcd.scroll(0, "Hello")</pre>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you use this on both lines of the screen?</li>
      <li>Want to change the speed? Add another <strong>argument</strong> into this function: <code>speed=200</code></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="rgb-led" class="left">
    <h3>Using the RGB LED</h3>
    <p>An RGB has been connected to your board as well - this is three lights in one.</p>
    <p>We have told the ESP32 where they have been connected, using this syntax:</p>
    <pre>    red = Pin(14, Pin.OUT, Pin.PULL_DOWN)</pre>
    <br>
    <p>To use them, you can turn on, or off, each of the three colours. For example:</p>
    <pre>    red.on()
    green.off()
    blue.off()</pre>
    <br>
    <h5>Extra challenge:</h5>
    <p>Once you have turned on a colour, it will stay on until you tell it to turn back off again.</p>
    <p>To change from red to blue, you need to turn off red and turn on blue, if you don't turn off red, you will get purple.</p>
    <p>To make it easier to use lots of colours, you can define some <strong>functions</strong> for each.</p>
    <pre># define your new function
def make_purple():
    red.on()
    green.off()
    blue.on()

# use your new function
make_purple()</pre>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="loop" class="left">
    <h3>Make something change</h3>
    <p>Until now, we have been setting up code to happen just once.</p>
    <p>You might have noticed the <code>while True</code> near the end of the programme, which currently doesn't do very much.</p>
    <p><code>while True</code> is Python's version of a forever loop. Currently, the thing that happens forever is:</p>
    <pre>gc.collect()</pre>
    <br>
    <p>This code runs in the background to free up some memory, and helps all the code run smoothly!</p>
    <p>You can add more things into this loop though, for example, to flash an LED.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Try this code example:</p>
    <pre>    while True:
        gc.collect()
        if red.value() == 1:
            red.off()
        else:
            red.on()
        await asyncio.sleep(1)</pre>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Check whether the red LED is on (is the value 1?)</li>
      <li>If it is on, turn it off</li>
      <li>If it is not on, turn it on</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This causes the red led to flash every time the loop runs.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you work out how quickly the loop will repeat at the moment?</li>
      <li>Remember the syntax we used to pause, can you speed up or slow down the loop?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="sensors" class="left">
    <h3>Switch code, and use the environment sensor</h3>
    <p>Now that you have practiced with some of the <strong>outputs</strong>, we can add in the <strong>inputs</strong> - specifically the environmental sensor for your air quality monitor!</p>
    <p>Save first-test.py, and open <strong>session1.py</strong> in Thonny.</p>
    <p>There is a lot more code in this one, as more libraries and more set-up code is necessary to get everything working.</p>
    <p>Look through the file without changing anything first - which parts match what you have used so far?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you find where to edit the starting message on the LCD screen?</li>
      <li>Where would you add code to turn on the RGB LED?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Research time!</h5>
    <p>You will be able to get four main pieces of data from the sensor:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Temperature</li>
      <li>Humidity level</li>
      <li>CO2 level</li>
      <li>VOC level</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>In pairs, investigate one of these sensors, finding our information such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What is it actually measuring?</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>E.g. temperature is measuring how hot or cold the air is.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>What units are usually used?</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>E.g. we usually measure temperature in degrees Celsius (&deg;C).</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>What range would you expect in a house?</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>E.g. a temperature range of 15-25 would be fairly normal, depending on the time of year and whether the heating was on!</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>What numbers would you want to warn people about?</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>E.g. if the temperature got too hot or two cold I would want to give a warning.</li>
        <li>If it got lower than 15&deg;C I would warn you to put the heating on if you are in the house.</li>
        <li>If it got lower than 5&deg;C I would warn you to put the heating on even if nobody is home.</li>
        <li>If it got higher than 25&deg;C I would warn you to shut the curtains to keep out the sun.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Link to your research, coming soon!</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Investigating the sensors</h5>
    <p>Currently, the sensor information is showing up in the terminal - can you find the four sensors amongst the information?</p>
    <p>We have created four <strong>variables</strong> for the four sensors, in preperation for displaying on the screen - look for them in your code.</p>
    <p>To start with, pick two sensors to show on your LCD screen, in the example below, I have chosen Temperature and CO2 levels:</p>
    <pre>lcd[0] = str(temp)
lcd[1] = str(co2)</pre>
    <br>
    <p>The sensor data updates every <strong>30 seconds</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are you getting the sorts of numbers you expect based on your research?</li>
      <li>How can you change the data the sensor is receiving? Can you breath on it, or move to a different area of the classroom?</li>
    </ul>
